				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>Bet to Hit is a small mini game which was created by Christoph Lipphart.</p>
				<h2>The Fight</h2>
				<p>
					Two worms are fighting against each other. They try to smash the other one back into the black hole they were coming from.
					There are three different worms which are using unique weapons.
				</p>
				<h2>Worms</h2>
					<p><strong>Lefti</strong> is the tallest but weakest worm. He learned to fight on the construction sides where he worked.</p>
					<p><strong>Schleimi</strong> is the power woman between the two male worms. She eats a lot and therefore it isn't easy to smash her back into the deep.</p>
					<p><strong>Starki</strong> goes to the fitness centre each weekend. Does it really help him?</p>
				</p>
				<h2>Weapons</h2>
				<p><strong>Hammer</strong>, master of Iron - Swing it with care!</p>
				<p><strong>Schlag</strong> looks like a baseball bat.</p>
				<p><strong>Stock</strong> made from bamboo and is hard as steel.</p>
				<h2>Player Interaction</h2>
				<p>
					The player can bet who of the worms will win and earns money if he bet for the winning worm. <br />
					At the beginning of each round the player can win the double value of his or her bet. As longer the round lasts and therefore as deeper the worms are smashed back into their holes the smaller the multiplier gets. Each of the two multipliers is relative to the opponents progress.

				<h1>Making Of</h1>
				<p>The game is created with HTML5 web technologies.</p>
				<h2>JavaScript Libraries</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>EaselJS</strong> is an easy to use node-based render engine for the HTML5 canvas.
					Besides the rendering of static images it has the power to create awesome sprite sheet animations.
					It supports HTML text, Google Fonts and self-created Bitmap fonts.

				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>TweenJS</strong> is an animation system which creates for each object an own animation queue.
					This queue can contain a property animations with duration and specified easing curve, wait states 
					and call commands which execute specified JavaScript functions.

				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>SoundJS</strong> abstracts the HTML5 sound implementation, making adding consistent cross-browser sound to your games or rich experiences much easier.

				<h2>Images</h2>
				<p>
					All graphics were created by myself. They were hand drawn with pencil on white paper, scanned and colourised with the computer.

				<h2>Sound</h2>
				<p><strong>Music</strong> "Pirates Love Daisies" by Washingtron</p>
				<p><strong>Sound Effects</strong> are self made. I recorded my own voice and edited with Audacity.
